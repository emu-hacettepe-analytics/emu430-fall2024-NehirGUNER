My first assignment has two parts.

## (a) A brief summary

In this part of the assignment, I have two research questions that I developed myself.

## (b)

```{r}

# Import the “polls_us_election_2016” data set.

install.packages("dslabs")

library(dslabs)

data(polls_us_election_2016)

# Display the first 10 rows of the data set on your web page.

polls_first10 <- head(polls_us_election_2016, 10)

polls_first10

```

```{r}

polls_first10 <- head(polls_us_election_2016, 10)

total_NA <- sum(is.na(polls_first10)) 

print(total_NA)


```
