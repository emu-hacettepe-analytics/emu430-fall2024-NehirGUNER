My first assignment has two parts.

## (a) A brief summary

In this part of the assignment, I have two research questions that I developed myself.

## (b)

```{'''{r}

# Kütüphaneyi yükle
library(dslabs)

# Veri setini yükle
data(polls_us_election_2016)

# İlk 10 satırı al
polls_first10 <- head(polls_us_election_2016, 10)

# NA değerlerini say
total_NA <- sum(is.na(polls_first10))

# Sonucu yazdır
print(total_NA)
''
```
