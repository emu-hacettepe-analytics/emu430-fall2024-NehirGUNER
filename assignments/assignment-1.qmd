# Assignment 1

```{r}
1 + 1
```

My first assignment has two parts.

## (a) A brief summary

In this part of the assignment, I have two research questions that I developed myself.

## (b)

```{r}
# Import the “polls_us_election_2016” data set

install.packages("dslabs")

library(dslabs)

data(polls_us_election_2016)

# Veri setinin ilk 10 satırını görüntüle
polls_head <- head(polls_us_election_2016, 10)

# Tabloyu düzgün bir formatta göster
knitr::kable(polls_head)

```
