My first assignment has two parts.

## (a) A brief summary

In this part of the assignment, I have two research questions that I developed myself.

## (b)

```{'''{r}
# Import the “polls_us_election_2016” data set.
if (!requireNamespace("dslabs", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("dslabs")
}

library(dslabs)

data(polls_us_election_2016)

# Display the first 10 rows of the data set.
polls_first10 <- head(polls_us_election_2016, 10)

# Calculate the total number of NA values in the first 10 rows
total_NA <- sum(is.na(polls_first10))

# Print the total number of NA values
print(total_NA)

''
```
