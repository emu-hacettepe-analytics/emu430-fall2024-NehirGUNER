My first assignment has two parts.

## (a) A brief summary

In this part of the assignment, I have two research questions that I developed myself.

## (b)

```{r}

# Import the “polls_us_election_2016” data set.

library(dslabs)

data(polls_us_election_2016)

# Display the first 10 rows of the data set on your web page.

knitr::kable(cbind(Row_Number = sprintf("%-2s", 1:10), head(polls_us_election_2016, 10)), 
             
caption = "Polls US Election 2016 - First 10 Rows")

```
