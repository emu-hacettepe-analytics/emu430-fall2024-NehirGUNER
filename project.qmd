**Summary**

The aim of our project is to examine the impact of electric vehicles (EVs) on CO2 emissions and analyze the integration of electric vehicles in Turkey. Electric vehicles stand out for their environmental benefits, particularly their potential to reduce CO2 emissions. The study concludes that while EV adoption has the potential to significantly reduce transportation-related emissions, its effectiveness depends on factors such as population density and the transition to renewable energy sources.
