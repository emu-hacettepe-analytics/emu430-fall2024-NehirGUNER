    "text": "Hi! I‚Äôm Nehir. I was born on July 20, 2004, in Tokat. I lived there until I was 14, after which I moved to Ankara with my family, and I have been living in this beautiful city for the last six years. Although I have been sensitive to justice and human rights issues and dreamed of studying law since childhood, I became fascinated with the world of positive sciences during high school and decided to pursue a career in engineering. My interest in innovation, mathematics, and analytical thinking, combined with my social skills, communication, and planning passion, led me to believe that industrial engineering was the right path for me. Influenced by the beauty of the Hacettepe campus and the Green Valley, I started my university life in a department that I believe will significantly develop me academically and in terms of vision. As of this year, I am in my third year of study, and my excitement grows alongside my passion as I continue my studies in the department.\n\nEducation\n\nB.S., Industrial Engineering, Hacettepe University, Turkey, 2022 - ongoing.\n\n\n\nWork Experience\nI have no internship or work experience yet, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm not enthusiastic about working in the field of industrial engineering.

    "text": "(a) A brief summary\nIn this session, Cem Vardar enlightens us with valuable insights into data analysis, his area of expertise, as well as into the business world. Personally, I feel that his positive energy adds a great dynamic to our class. üòä\nYou can access the recording of this wonderful interview using the link below:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi8-phj1X1A\nBelow, I‚Äôll try to chronologically outline the main topics covered in our discussion.\n\nWhat is Engineering?\nEngineering can be defined as problem-solving through scientific techniques, particularly leveraging mathematics and technological advancements. Engineers typically engage in projects focusing on system improvement and innovation. What sets industrial engineering apart from other fields is its focus on solving problems within highly complex systems. Industrial engineers may specialize in various areas to address these complexities, including:\n\nLogistics\nOperations research\nSimulation\nQuality modeling\nSupply chain and inventory management\n\n\n\nQuestion 1: Is the ‚ÄúIf It Works, Don‚Äôt Touch It‚Äù Principle Valid?\nComplex system behaviors are difficult to define, making it risky to overhaul entire processes. Instead, incremental improvements‚Äîtargeting core issues one by one‚Äîmay prove more effective.\n\n\nData Engineering and Industrial Engineering\nData engineering focuses on data collection, classification, and deriving insights from data. Industrial engineering, on the other hand, uses these insights to make decisions and create plans. Due to the analytical skills and way of thinking developed in industrial engineering, individuals in this field can also work effectively in data analysis.\n\n\nQuestion 2: Can Business Analysis Be Considered Part of Data Analysis?\nData analysis provides tools to solve problems and make informed decisions, while business analysis identifies the root causes of problems through data. Thus, they‚Äôre related fields that both center on data and problem-solving.\n\n\nDesired Qualities and Recommendations\nTwo essential categories of skills are sought in data analysis: soft and technical skills. Soft skills include communication, social skills, analytical thinking, problem-solving, curiosity, and a desire to understand, as well as holistic thinking. Technical skills cover basics like statistics and programming, as well as data collection, processing, modeling, and visualization.\nMany of these skills can be developed over time. Soft skills will be valuable in many areas of your career, while technical skills can be learned as needed. Focusing on problems rather than tools can help develop technical skills more effectively. Knowing yourself is a lifelong asset.\n‚ÄúWhat feels like play to you, but looks like work to others?‚Äù &lt;3\n\n\nRecommended Reading/Listening/Viewing\n\nHow to Get Rich ‚Äî podcast\nMental Models\nFooled by Randomness\nThe Goal\nAtomic Habits\n\n\n\nQ&A Session\n+ How have your master‚Äôs and Ph.D.¬†studies impacted your career?\n‚ÄúTwenty years ago, self-development opportunities were fewer. Now, it‚Äôs different, which has lessened the importance of advanced degrees somewhat.‚Äù\n+ How can inter-departmental data coordination issues be addressed in the business world?\n‚ÄúManagement‚Äôs recognition is key. Once identified, solutions like data warehousing can improve coordination.‚Äù\n+ Any personal achievements or regrets?\n‚ÄúGaining experience in various fields was invaluable. I would have prioritized self-knowledge even more.‚Äù\n+ How will AI impact the industry?\n‚ÄúFor technical fields like engineering, the benefits will likely outweigh the downsides.‚Äù\n(Here‚Äôs to not being entirely replaced by 24.11.2028‚Ä¶)\n+ Thoughts on handling limited versus extensive data?\n‚ÄúUsing minimal data for tasks that require substantial information can reduce reliability. Of course, the scale of data matters here.‚Äù\n+ Operations Research vs.¬†Statistics: which specialization is wiser?\n‚ÄúGaining knowledge in multiple fields is generally more beneficial for the business world. But if you want to specialize, focus on what you genuinely enjoy rather than only on market value.‚Äù\nIn this part of the assignment, I have two research questions that I developed myself:\nQuestion1: Why is a problem-solving approach prioritized in a data analysis process?\na) Because data sets are generally small\nb) Because tools may quickly become obsolete\nc) Because only soft skills are sufficient in the business world\nd) Because it only requires technical knowledge\nAnswer: b) Because tools may quickly become obsolete\nQuestion2: What type of analysis approach would you recommend to maximize the impact of data analysis on business processes?\nAnswer: To maximize the impact of data analysis on business processes, I recommend adopting a data-driven decision-making approach. This strategy involves collecting relevant data, analyzing it, and using the insights gained to inform business decisions.\nExample: For instance, suppose a company wants to enhance its customer retention. It could analyze customer behavior data to identify patterns, such as which customers are most likely to churn and why.\nIf the analysis reveals that customers who make frequent purchases in the first few months are more likely to stay, the company can implement a targeted retention program. This might include personalized follow-ups or special offers for these customers shortly after their initial purchase. By leveraging data insights, the company can tailor its strategies to keep valuable customers, thereby maximizing the effectiveness of its business processes.",
